## Quickstart; Run the Game


See commands to run the game in `commands.txt` [the commands are parsed by `readCommand` located in `pacman.py`]

(E.g.) `python pacman.py -p ReflexAgent -l testClassic`

Choose levels available in the `layouts` directory. Note, there are more levels available in the UofT starter code [not given here].



#### Command Line Options (from `pacman.py` file)
- `'-n', '--numGames'`, the number of games to play. Only works with `quietTextGraphics` option.
- `'-l', '--layout'`, the layout_file in `layouts` from which to load the map layout. default='mediumClassic'.
- `'-p', '--pacman'`, the agent type in the `multiAgents` module to use. default='KeyboardAgent' in `keyboardAgents.py`.
- `'-t', '--textGraphics'`, Display output as text only (like our Sokoban game). default=False.
- `'-q', '--quietTextGraphics'`, Instant feedback with score. Generate minimal output and no graphics. default=False.
- `'-s', '--silent'`, Prevent print statements of game results when finished. default=False.
- `'-g', '--ghosts'`, the ghost agent type in the `ghostAgents` module to use (only other option is `DirectionalGhost`, which makes it hard for PacMan). default='RandomGhost'.
- `'-k', '--numghosts'`, The maximum number of ghosts to use. This doesn't apply to GUI or textGraphics mode, so who knows what its for. default=4.
- `'-z', '--zoom'`, Zoom the size of the graphics window. default=1.0
- `'-f', '--fixRandomSeed'`, Fixes the random seed to always play the same game. default=False
- `'-r', '--recordActions'`, Writes game history to a file (named by the time they were played) into the`recorded-games` directory. default=False.
- `'--replay'`, A recorded game file (object pickle'd in binary) from `recordActions` to replay. default=None.
    - E.g. usage, `python pacman.py --replay <name-of-recorded-game>`
- `'-a','--agentArgs'`, Comma separated values sent to agent. e.g. "opt1=val1,opt2,opt3=val3".
- `'-x', '--numTraining'`, How many episodes are training (suppresses output). default=0    <== TODO/FIXME
- `'--frameTime'`, Time to delay between frames; <0 means keyboard. default=0.1
- `'-c', '--catchExceptions'`, Turns on exception handling and timeouts during games. default=False.
- `'--timeout'`, Maximum length of time an agent can spend computing in a single game. default=30.
